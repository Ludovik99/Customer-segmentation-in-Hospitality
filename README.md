# Customer-segmentation-in-Hospitality

Customer Segmentation and Analysis in the Hospitality sector with customized recommendations.

The project provides an overview of an hotel customer base, clustered through a K-Means algorithm (on Dataiku) based on a specifically-computed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) value for each of the customers. After segmenting customers in three different segments based on their RFM scores, specific suggestions have been drafted for each of the three cases. The prospect also provides an overview on the evolution of the study and a brief glance on the feature engineering part.

> The work has been supervised by Professor Daniel Tapiador, PhD, Data Science Associate Director at BCG.
